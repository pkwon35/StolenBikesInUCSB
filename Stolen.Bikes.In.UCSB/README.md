# Bikes Stolen in UCSB (Campus)

## Abstract
This project is a exploratory analysis of bikes stolen on the UCSB campus. We use visualizations to get an idea of geographically, which bike locations on campus are the most vulnerable for bicycles. We used R and R Studio to create this project.

The required packages used in this project are:

data.table
base
ggplot2

## Methodology
In order to proceed with this project, we received our data from the UCSB Police Department. Most of our work went into cleaning and standardizing the data, as well as figuring out what bike parking spots on campus. 
We did not see the noticeable differences in the influence of each parking location until we saw it visualized on a map.

## Conclusion
From the visualizations and interactive bar graphs, we conlcuded that the bike racks that were the most effected were the major ones on campus such as the UCSB Library and the SRB.
